* Lightweight
* Field Targeting
* Tracking of User Behaviour
 * Fields visited by the user.

 * Time spent on each field.
 * Values filled in each field.


USAGE
--
* Include script in your html/tpl

        <script type=”text/javascript” src=”tnmplugin.js”></script>

* Create an object of tnm class, just before the closing `</body>` tag

        var objtnm = new tnm();

* After the object is created, add tnm methods to appropriate window events
       
         window.onload = function () {objtnm.init();}
         window.onunload = function() { objtnm.LogCatch.call(objtnm);}

* The plugin have some configuration variables, which can be specified in following manner:
  * tnmLogPath: Path to the script which would log the data captured by the plugin.
  
              objtnm.tnmLogPath = “savelog.php”

             <?php
                $log = $_POST['log'];
                $fileName = <PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>
                $fph = fopen($fileName, "a+");
                $logstr = $log."\n";
                fputs($fph, $logstr);
                fclose($fph);
             ?>
             
  * tnmLogArray: Specify the variables to be captured i.e. value / error
   
               objtnm.tnmLogArray={“value”:true, “error”:false, “links”:false}  

      * Setting value to true would also log values of the fields in the form / page, along
with the time and motion data.
      * Setting error to true would also also errors of the fields in the form / page, along with
the time and motion data.
      * Setting links to true would start capturing clicks on the links in the form / page,
along with the time and motion data.
  * tnmLogFields: This can be used to target certain fields for logging data.
 
TODO
---
1. Capture Page Load times.
2. Add Log Parsing / Report Generation Script(s).
3. Configure pushing of data at the defined interval(s), instead of on page unload.
